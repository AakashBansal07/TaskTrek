## Possible Improvements
- ### UI
    - More polished and consistent UI
    - Could make UI using ncurses.
- ### Performance
    - Better way to access tasks and events from file for operations  like deletion. Right now, linear search is used for that purpose. Hashmaps can be used.
    - Functions like strcpy() could be avoided and pointers could be used instead for better performance.
    - Recursive calls could be avoided.
    - memmove() could get expensive for large amounts of data. Custom function could be used.
    - File operations could be used wisely.
- ### Pending Features
    - The Notes feature could be implemented
